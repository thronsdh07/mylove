        <h1>Dear Sneha...❤️</h1>
        <p>
            I know this might sound strange, and I hope this doesn’t make things awkward between us, but I’ve been thinking for a while now that I should let you know something important, something I’ve been feeling for some time.<br>


            We only meet once every few months, but every time we do, it feels like no time has passed at all. The way we talk, laugh, and just… exist in each other's company—it’s something I cherish deeply. It’s a rare kind of connection, the kind that doesn’t require constant reminders to keep the bond alive. And maybe that’s why I’ve never really thought too much about what it means for me.<br>



            But I realized something recently. That feeling, the one where I’m always so at ease with you, is because you mean more to me than just a friend. It’s complicated, I know. And I’m not trying to complicate things or make them awkward. I value our friendship above all, and I never want to risk losing that. I’ve been content with being there for you, supporting you, and sharing those moments whenever they come. But there’s a part of me that can’t help but feel something deeper, something more than just friendship.<br>


            You’re two years older than me, and I’m sure it might seem strange that I feel this way, but age, honestly, never mattered to me. The connection we share, the way you light up a room and bring warmth into my life, is what matters. And even though I may never say this out loud when we meet, I wanted you to know that I care about you in ways that go beyond simple friendship.<br>


            I know nothing needs to change. I’m not asking for anything. I just needed to say it out loud, because keeping it inside only makes it harder to keep being your friend without being true to my feelings.<br>


            I hope this doesn’t change anything between us. You mean so much to me, and I will continue to be here as your friend, just as I always have been.<br>


            Take care,<br>
